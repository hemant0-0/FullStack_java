Constructor - Constructor is special type of method and it call when the object of class is created.

Types of Constructor-
    1.Default constructor
    2.Parameterized constructor

Rules of creating constructor-
                        1. Class name and constructor name should be same.
                        2. we can not declare return type explicitly.
                        3. we can not declare constructor abstract,static or synchronized

Access Modifier

  1. public - Public is accessible through out the project
  2. private - private is accessible only within class
  3. protected - protected is accessible only within a package,
                 but accessible in another package through inheritance
  4. default - it is accessible only within a package. and it is more restrictive than protected.

Polymorphism -
            It is ability to take many forms.
            ex-
            1 . Method overloading - if same method name have multiple time is same class it is called method overloading.
                                     It increases program readability.
            rule for method overloading - 1. same name but different number of parameters
                                          2. same number of parameter but different datatype.

            2. Method Overriding - If child class have same method name in that parent class then is called method overriding.


Local Variable => if we declare variable within method this is called Local Variable. They are accessible within a method
Instance Variable -> Instance Variable are declared at class level


Throwable ->
           1. Exception-
                        1.IOException
                        2.SQLException
                        3.RuntimeException
                                    - ArithmaticException
                                    - NullpointerException
                                    - NumberFormatException
                                    - IndexOutOfBoundException -
                                                           - ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException
                                                           - StringIndexOutOfBoundException

           2. Error-
                    1.StackOverFlowError
                    2.OutOfMemoryError

**** There are two types Exception
            1. Checked Exception-
                    except RuntimeException all exception are come
            2. Unchecked Exception -
                    All Run time exception are unchecked exceptions
